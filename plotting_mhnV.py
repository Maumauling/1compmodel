plotting routine for data generated via 1compmodel; mhnV runge kutta solution

wanted structure: if channelplotting = True -> in plot also channel kinetics, but can be only membrane voltage and so on. 

proposed structure:
    first define boolean variables for how much in plot included
    second go into if loop
    
    maybe beforehand plotting fcts need to be defined
